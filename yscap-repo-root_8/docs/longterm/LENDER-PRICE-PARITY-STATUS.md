  LENDER PRICE BACKEND ↔ FRONTEND PARITY — implementation status.
  A developer-grade map of the A-to-Z Lender Price audit onto the backend code:
  what is fixed (with file + behavior + data types), what is deferred (with the
  EXACT thing needed to close it), and the current request-builder field contract.

# Lender Price backend ↔ frontend parity — status

Scope: the Long-Term DSCR pricer's Lender Price integration
(`src/longterm/lenderprice/`), against the developer's A-to-Z parity audit. This
document is the backend counterpart to that audit — every finding mapped to code,
with accepted data types and defaults.

## 0. Two things that are NOT code (need a human)

- **Production API health.** The audit could not run live backend↔frontend
  comparisons because the deployed LT `/health` did not respond (the reboot →
  "server briefly unavailable"). The backup job's "database system is in recovery
  mode" is the same event: the production Postgres was recovering. **Someone with
  Render access must confirm the DB finished recovering and the LT health
  endpoint answers** before any live parity test can run. No code change here can
  fix a database in recovery.
- **`LP_REQUIRE_LIVE_FOUNDATION=1`** should be set in Render so production can
  never silently price on the static fallback foundation (the gate already exists
  — `client.js foundationLiveGate`, named 502 `lp_foundation_not_live`).

## 1. Fixed (with the exact behavior + data types)

Each item is covered by an offline test in `scripts/test-lt-lenderprice.js`,
`scripts/test-lt-dscr-routes.js`, or `scripts/test-lt-lp-disqualify-store-db.js`.

| Audit finding | Status | Where / behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash-out amount** (newest — vendor fixed the field) | FIXED | The frontend now sends numeric `criteria.cashoutAmount`. `buildSearch` sets `criteria.cashoutAmount = num(cashoutAmount)` when supplied. The old dynamic-property-only path is retired; `LP_CASHOUT_AMOUNT_FIELD` kept as a legacy override. |
| **§3 appraised value manufactured** | FIXED | No longer copies estimated → appraised. Purchase → `appraisedValue = value`; refinance/cash-out → **blank** unless `asIsValue`/`appraisedValue` supplied. |
| **§1 DSCR defaults not enforced** (24mo reserves / 30yr / 30-day lock) | FIXED | Forced when omitted: `loanYear=30`, `dayLocks=30`, `GLOBAL_RESERVES=Reserves_24`. Overrides a live default carrying different values. |
| **§6 property/attachment joined** | FIXED | New independent `attachment` (`Detached`/`Attached`) and `nonWarrantable` (boolean) inputs override the type's defaults; invalid attachment → 422. |
| **§7 term/lock lists outdated** | FIXED | Live frontend lists: terms `5, 8..30, 40`; locks `10,12,15,21,25,30,40,45,60,75,90,120,180`. Env-overridable. 17-year now valid; the invisible 14-day lock now rejected. |
| **Isolated LTV > 100%** | FIXED | A supplied `ltv` is range-checked on its own (`> 100%` → 422) whether or not value+loan were both given. `LP_MAX_LTV` overrides the 100% ceiling. |
| **Advanced numbers too permissive** | FIXED | `monthlyIncome / monthlyDebt / dti / financedProperties / numberOfBorrowers` strictly validated (integer/range); a malformed or out-of-range value → 422, never coerced. |
| **Wrong nested-JSON shape ignored** | FIXED | `bankruptcy` / `mortgageLates` sent as a string/array → 422 (never silently ignored). |
| **Explicit false doesn't override** | FIXED | `mixedUse` / `noMortgageHistory` four-state: omitted → inherit, true → on, **false → off**. (Off is sent as boolean `false`; confirm the vendor's off-token if a capture shows otherwise.) |
| **§2 omitted prepay cleared** | FIXED | An omitted prepay inherits the live default; only an explicit prepay (incl. `0` = No PPP) writes `PrepayTerm`/`PrePayment_Plan_Type`. |
| **effectiveScenario incomplete** | FIXED | Now includes reserves, rental term, prepay structure, complete location, `cashoutAmount`, and every SMO identity (`{id,name}`). |
| **Ineligible state in-memory only (reboot wipes it)** | FIXED | `db/559 lt_lp_disqualify_search` durable L2 behind the L1 Map; kickoff + cached result survive a reboot (poll rehydrates from Postgres). Best-effort — degrades to in-memory-only if the DB is down. `LP_DISQUALIFY_DURABLE=0` disables. |
| **Ineligible items: no per-lender cursor** | FIXED | `shapeDisqualified` gained `itemOffset` + per-lender `itemNextOffset`; a lender with more items than the cap is fully retrievable. |
| **§31.6 scenario-ownership leakage** (a live foundation carries a prior session's deal) | FIXED | `buildSearch` clears every scenario-owned field to a documented neutral BEFORE the DSCR profile + caller overlay (`clearScenarioOwnedFields` + the `SCENARIO_OWNED` registry). Targeted, not a wipe: a field outside the registry inherits unchanged (structural defaults, the io/escrow/fthb flags, prepay-when-omitted per §29.12.3). Covers `subordinateLoanAmount`/`lineAmount`/`rehabBudget`/`drawAmount`/`downPaymentAmount` (neutral `0`), the core economics `purchasePrice`/`loanAmount`/`ltv`/`fico`/`dscr` (neutral `null`, re-applied when the caller supplies them), `cashoutAmount` (neutral = absent), and `brokerCriteria.overrideExistingComplan` (neutral `false`). Every neutral is the captured base's own default, so clearing can only remove a stale value, never introduce one. Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-scenario-ownership-pure.js` (proven to FAIL with the clear removed). |
| **§29.1 DSCR profile enforcement over a LIVE foundation** | FIXED (proven) | `buildSearch` forces every DSCR-profile axis (occupancy, comp, income doc, rental term, reserves, term, lock, borrower type) over whatever the cloned live base carried; explicit `termYears`/`lockDays`/`borrowerType` still win. Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-dscr-profile-pure.js` passes a mutated live base and asserts each override (proven to FAIL when a forcing line is reverted) — closes §29.7's "the active path needs its own assertion". |
| **§29.10/§31.3 rental-term override + SemiDetached attachment** | FIXED | `rentalTerm` (`long`/`short`, case/space tolerant) selects `AddlOccupancyType` between the two confirmed live tokens `Long_Term_Rental_Property` (§30.6) / `Short_Term_Rental_Property` (§31.3); OMITTED forces long-term (the DSCR profile default); an unknown value → 422 (never silently long-term). `SemiDetached` (confirmed §31.3) added to the attachment allow-list. Both reachable over HTTP (route `SUPPORTED_FIELDS`). Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-rental-attachment-pure.js` (proven to FAIL when reverted). |
| **§31.3/§31.7 cross-collateral + first-time investor + living-rent-free** | FIXED | Three confirmed-token dynamic flags, all STRICT JSON booleans (a string `"false"` → 422). `crossCollateral` → `GLOBAL_Cross_Collateralization_Product` (STRING `"true"`/`"false"`, both confirmed §31.3); `firstTimeInvestor` → `FirstTimeInvestor` (STRING `"true"` §31.7); `livingRentFree` → `Global_Living_Rent_Free` (STRING `"true"` §31.7). **Confirmed quirk pinned**: these carry a STRING value, unlike `GLOBAL_MixedUse` (JSON boolean). **Never a guessed token**: cross-collateral sends the full tri-state (both `"true"`/`"false"` confirmed); first-time-investor/living-rent-free send ONLY the confirmed `"true"` — an explicit `false` inherits the live default rather than writing an unconfirmed off-token (add the `"false"` in one place once a capture confirms it). Omitted → inherit; reachable over HTTP + surfaced in `effectiveScenario`. Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-advanced-flags-pure.js` (proven to FAIL when reverted). |
| **§32.4 reserves selector table** (`reservesMonths` → `GLOBAL_RESERVES` enum) | FIXED | A caller may choose a reserves requirement via `reservesMonths`, mapped to the CONFIRMED live enum (`mapReserves`) — copied EXACTLY, including the genuinely inconsistent prefixes: `none`/`0`→`Reserve_none`, `3`→`Reserves_3`, **`6`→`Reserve_6` (SINGULAR)**, `12`→`Reserves_12`, `18`→`Reserves_18`, `24`→`Reserves_24`. OMITTED → the DSCR-profile default `Reserves_24` (env-overridable `LP_RESERVES_TOKEN`); an unknown value → 422 `unknown_reserves` (never a guessed token). Explicit `None` (`Reserve_none`) is DISTINCT from blank/inherit (JSON null); blank is deliberately not exposed — the DSCR profile always emits a reserves value. Reachable over HTTP (route `SUPPORTED_FIELDS`); `effectiveScenario.reserves` surfaces it. Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-reserves-pure.js` (full enum + the singular/plural quirk + 422 + fail-closed; proven to FAIL when `Reserve_6` is "fixed" to `Reserves_6`). |
| **§32.3 DSCR threshold table** (DSCRRATIO band token + derived pricing-band SMO) | FIXED | The entered DSCR drives, beyond the always-present DSCR pair, a coarse `dynamicPropertiesMap.DSCRRATIO` token AND — above 0.75 — one derived pricing-band SMO. Implemented as a **reviewed range table** (`dscrBand`), NOT string-formatted from the number: `0→NoDSCR`, `(0,0.75)→"0.75"`, `[0.75,1.00)→"DSCR<1"+"DSCR <1.15"`, `[1.00,1.25)→"DSCR>=1"+"DSCR >=1.00"`, `[1.25,∞)→"1.25"+"DSCR >=1.25 - J"` (every token confirmed from the §32.3 capture; discontinuities at 0/0.75/1.00/1.25). `criteria.dscr` carries the verbatim numeric value; the band SMO is appended after the DSCR pair (captured order `[PPP, DSCVR, DSCR, band]`, name-only + `dynaToSmo`). **Fail-closed**: `DSCRRATIO` is scenario-owned (`SCENARIO_OWNED` DELETE-neutral) so an omitted DSCR sends NO token — a live foundation's stale `DSCRRATIO` cannot leak — and is re-applied when supplied. Surfaced in `effectiveScenario.dscrRatio`. Test `scripts/test-lt-lp-dscr-band-pure.js` (full table + boundary just-below/at/just-above + fail-closed; proven to FAIL when a boundary is moved). |

Two permanent **golden request-structure fixtures** encode the audit's canonical
DSCR purchase and cash-out combination (`test-lt-lenderprice.js` sections 35–36).

## 2. Deferred — and EXACTLY what closes each

These are **not guessed**, on purpose: a wrong token or a partial table would
mis-price, which is worse than the current explicit-reject behavior.

- **§5 other derived SMO selectors** (Non-Warrantable Condo SMO, Prepay Buyout).
  `nonWarrantableProject` is already a criteria field; `dynaToSmo:true` may derive
  the SMO. **Needs a capture** confirming whether the frontend sends an explicit
  SMO id/name for these vs. relying on `dynaToSmo`.
- **Omitted property type inheriting the live default** (vs. defaulting to
  SingleFamily). Deferred until production health is restored so the change can be
  validated against the LIVE foundation (the static base is a 2–4-unit capture and
  cannot stand in for it).
- **Explicit reserves as a user input** (the token `GLOBAL_RESERVES` is known;
  the value set — `Reserves_0/12/24/...` — needs a capture to enumerate).
- **Search generation identity (§C2).** The current byte-identical-search de-dup
  is idempotent by design (§27.4); giving each intentional new search its own
  generation while keeping polls idempotent needs an owner decision on the desired
  semantics.
- The **coverage-gap fields** the audit lists (asset depletion, cross-collateral,
  student-loan cash-out, subordinate/CLTV, comp %, first-time investor, ITIN
  distinctions, AUS, Section 184, several property types, ZIP→county-FIPS
  enrichment) are **rejected with 422, not silently ignored** — each needs its
  confirmed upstream token from a capture before it is implemented.

## 3. The request-builder field contract (accepted types)

Scenario field → upstream path → type → default/validation (as of the fixes
above). Anything not in this list is **rejected 422** (`unsupported_field`).

- `purpose` → `criteria.loanPurpose` — enum `Purchase`|`Cash out`(→`CashoutRefinance`)|`Refinance`; unknown → 422.
- `value` → `criteria.purchasePrice` — number ≥ 1.
- `appraisedValue`/`asIsValue` → `criteria.appraisedValue` — number ≥ 1; else purchase→value, refi/cashout→blank.
- `loan` → `criteria.loanAmount` — number ≥ 1; `loan > value` → 422.
- `ltv` → `criteria.ltv` — number; accepts `75` or `0.75`; > 100% → 422; must agree with loan/value.
- `fico` → `criteria.fico` — integer 300–850.
- `dscr` → `criteria.dscr` — number 0–2.
- `propertyType` → `property.propertyType` (+ attachment/units defaults) — enum (see `field-registry.PROPERTY_TYPES`); unknown → 422.
- `attachment` → `property.attachmentType` — enum `Detached`|`Attached`.
- `nonWarrantable` → `criteria.nonWarrantableProject` — boolean.
- `units` → `property.numberOfUnit` — integer 1–20; must agree with property type.
- `termYears`/`term` → `criteria.loanYear` + `termsCriteria` — one of the live terms; default 30.
- `lockDays` → `brokerCriteria.dayLocks` + `dayLocksCriteria` — one of the live locks; default 30.
- `prepayMonths` → `dynamicPropertiesMap.PrepayTerm` — number (0 = No PPP); omitted → inherit.
- `cashoutAmount` → `criteria.cashoutAmount` — number ≥ 0.
- `borrowerType` → `dynamicPropertiesMap.GLOBAL_BorrowerType` — default `LLC`.
- `io`/`escrowWaive`/`fthb` → `criteria.interestOnly`/`escrowWaiver`/`firstTimeHomeBuyer` — strict boolean.
- Location: `zip`/`state`/`city`/`county`/`countyName`/`countyFps` → `property.address.*` — ZIP/state without a 5-digit countyFips → 422 (frontend enriches ZIP→FIPS).
- Advanced (strict): `selfEmployed`, `financedProperties`(int 0–100), `numberOfBorrowers`(int 1–10), `monthlyIncome`(≥0), `monthlyDebt`(≥0), `dti`(0–100), `compensationType`, `waiveLenderFee`, `rural`, `mixedUse`, `citizenship`, `tradelines`, `noMortgageHistory`, `bankruptcy`{chapter,status,seasoning}, `mortgageLates`{last12,months13To24}, `foreclosure`/`shortSale`/`deedInLieu`/`chargeOff`/`forbearance` (enum tokens in `field-registry`).
- Always forced (DSCR profile): `propertyUse=Investment`, `compensationType=BorrowerCompPlan`, `IncomeDocType=DSCR`, `AddlOccupancyType=Long_Term_Rental_Property`, `GLOBAL_RESERVES=Reserves_24`, all-rates/all-prices, disqualify kickoff flags.

## 4. Running the tests

- `node scripts/test-lt-lenderprice.js` — request builder + golden fixtures (offline).
- `node scripts/test-lt-dscr-routes.js` — routes, item cursor, effectiveScenario (offline).
- `DATABASE_URL=… node scripts/test-lt-lp-disqualify-store-db.js` — durable ineligible store (reboot survival).
- `node scripts/test-lt-lenderprice.js --live` — real Lender Price battery (needs credentials + healthy production).
